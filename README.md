# Airline On-Time Performance

An analysis of U.S. flights over the years 2014 to 2019 with data provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This was a group project for STAT 3202 at The Ohio State University during the Spring Semester of 2019 assigned by professor David Dalpiaz.

The original project description by the instructor can be seen <a href="https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat3202-sp19/project/proj-02/proj-02.html">here</a>.

### Notes

The data in this repository "flightData.sqlite3" is a vastly paired-down version of the real data that was used. The .Rmd file can be run with this data, but it is merely for testing purposes. If, for whatever reason you want to run the .Rmd using the full data set (an sqlite database that is over 2 GB when decompressed), the 7zip file containing it can be accessed from my Google Drive <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gDvRqTy7rbDxN-idM0_hIl9KCTx7PPMk">here</a>.

This database is something I assembled myself for the purposes of the project. All of the data can be accessed at the website of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=">here</a>.

### My Contribution

The "Methods" section (paragraph and table) as well as everything from "Proportion Tests for Top 8 Carriers" to the very bottom were all written by myself, as well as bits of the other parts. My group members were mostly involved with the presentation prior to the report rather than the report itself. I believe the code in the .Rmd reflects my improved understanding of the R style compared with my <a href="https://github.com/charles-m-doan/global-alcohol-consumption">previous project</a>. In particular, from this project I learned how to create and interact with a database using queries and piping commands.
